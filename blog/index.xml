      <description>Before diving into machine learning, it is better to familiarize oneself with the tools, paradigms, and the outcome that is to be achieved. In this article, we will try to cover the basics of Tensorflow Variables and how they work.
NOTE: Before proceeding, it is best to Install Tensorflow if you havenâ€™t already, but it is not strictly required for this tutorial.
What are Tensorflow Variables? Tensorflow Variables are used to store, reference and manipulate data just like any other variable, although they&amp;rsquo;re much more than just that.</description>

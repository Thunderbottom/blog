Hi, my name is Chinmay D. Pai. I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at Mumbai University. I like programming in Python and bash. I avidly support [FOSS Foundation][1] through my open source projects and I use [Void Linux][2] on my old MacBook Pro.

I love creating new projects, especially something that automates a certain task that I am too bored to manually perform. My dad thinks I am really smart, I am not but please don't let him know.

You can find me on [GitHub][3], or you can contact me through [email][4].


## Contact

* I check my [email][4] many times a day.
* I am also quite active on [telegram][5]. 
* I frequently browse [hackernews][6] and [tildes][7].
* If you would like to hire me, here is a copy of my [resume][8].
